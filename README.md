# shipeiqian's-code-of-practice

+ Just some code I practice.
+ I am a junior high school student. These codes are what I learned, for example on Codeforce, Luogu, or ATcoder. I have only been learning C++ for about a year and half. So I still can not code well.
+ Do not use the code anywhere else.
